= Ansible roles to manage my infrastructure

This repository contains a collection of roles I wrote to automate my infrastructure's deployment. My homelab consists in few services mainly running in Docker containers through compose files in Debian VMs in a Proxmox host. This also comes at the time I'm migrating from Nginx to Caddy to simplify my configurations and also escape some limitations I was experimenting (since I was using NPM and not vanilla Nginx). Here are the roles I'm working on:

* link:./roles/bootstrap_vm/README.adoc[VM bootstrap using template]
* link:./roles/docker/README.adoc[Docker installation]
* link:./roles/unattended-upgrades/README.adoc[Auto upgrades]
* Caddy setup
* link:./roles/wireguard/README.adoc[Wireguard setup]
* Nextcloud setup
* Gitea setup
* Hedgedoc setup
* Mealie setup
* Scrutiny setup
* Rustdesk setup
* Cryptpad setup
