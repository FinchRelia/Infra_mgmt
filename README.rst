Ansible roles to manage my infrastructure
=========================================

This repository contains simple roles I wrote to automate my infrastructure's deployment. My homelab consists in few services mainly running in Docker containers through compose files in Debian VMs in a Proxmox host. This also comes at the time I'm migrating from Nginx to Caddy to simplify my configurations and also escape some limitations I was experimenting (since I was using NPM and not vanilla Nginx). Here are the roles I'm working on:

* VM installation through already existing template
* Docker installation
* Caddy setup
* Wireguard setup
* Nextcloud setup
* Gitea setup
* Hedgedoc setup
* Mealie setup
* Scrutiny setup
* Rustdesk setup
* Cryptpad setup
